                  <h2 class="section-heading">A New Challenge</h2>

                  <p>After graduating in April of this year, I would never have imagined joining a web development immersive program, let alone know that one exists. I spent my time at the University of Michigan on the pre-medical tract, and finished with a Bachelors of Science in Biopsychology, Cognition and Neuroscience. While pursuing a medical degree seemed exciting – long story short – it took my three and a half years to realize that medical school may not be the right fit for me. I wanted to start my career right away and get my hands dirty. But, the next question was how?</p>

                    <p>I’ve always considered myself an intelligent and analytical individual, so I figured finding an entry-level position in marketing, analytics, or research would be reasonably achievable (hopefully). After countless applications and too few phone interviews, I was left unexcited with my job prospects. I didn’t realize how hard it would be to land that first job. But the one thing that kept popping up on job listings was programming, and how anyone with relevant coding experience, such as Computer Science majors, would have extra qualifications for these positions. I decided to spice up my qualifications by signing up for Codecademy – a well known learn-it-yourself platform in tech world. Once I got a knack for it, I wanted more. I began to browse around for more coding resources in Javascript, because this language really seemed to resonate with me.</p>

                    <p>And then boom! I stumbled upon General Assembly and their web development program. I instantly fell in love with the idea of becoming a web developer; the thought of learning more about the intricacies of the computer and being able to build a site on my own filled me with excitement. I couldn’t wait for my class to start!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Looking forward</h2>

                    <p>So here I am now – 3 weeks into the program and really getting into the coding groove. I didn’t realize how frustrating it might be, but also how utterly rewarding. As we’ve dove deeper into HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, I’ve seen how complicated yet infinite the number of animations and layouts that can go into a web page. Even though some of it still goes over my head, it makes me consider the impact of a web page’s design and functionality has on the user. There’s been times that I have been on a page and completely quitted out of it because the layout was so frustrating. And being the psych/neuroscience major that I am, I started to question the implications of psychology on web development, and how this effects the user experience and the success of a web page overall.</p>

                    <p>So, it you’ve gotten this far, you’ve learned a little bit about where by web dev journey is going. Keep checking in to see my discoveries in web design, and how my psych experience will influence my programming projects to come. I’m so excited!</p>

                    <p>Got web dev on the mind...?</p>
